# Exonum Python light client documentation

Documentation for this library is generated via [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

To install sphinx (from here it is assumed that you work inside venv and `python` defaults to `python3` and `pip` defaults to `pip3`), run:

```sh
pip install sphinx
```

To build docs locally:

```sh
make html
```

To change the settings for sphinx, edit [conf.py](conf.py).

To change the docs, edit appropriate `*.rst` file.

The entry point of the docs is the `index.rst`.
